# CRUD

Implement CRUD

I use c# in the backend and boostrap framework in the frontend 
to accomplish functions of manage students' enroll records.

There are three tables in my database CRUD. 
Student table stores students personal information such as firstname, lastname, email.
Course table stores information about different courses. 
Enroll_Records table has enroll records and links with the other two tables with two foreign keys. 

In the CRUD.aspx, you can input student's personal informations and his/her course in the enroll form.
See enroll records at the bottom of page and delete them through a button.
